# Artwork Verification for Native Media Controls

## Implementation Summary
Successfully integrated TrendAnkara logo artwork into native media controls using expo-video's metadata system.

## Technical Implementation

### Artwork Resolution
```javascript
// Convert local asset to URI
const artworkUri = Image.resolveAssetSource(require('@/assets/images/Trendankara3.png'))?.uri;

// Include in metadata
metadata: {
  title: 'TrendAnkara Radyo',
  artist: 'Canlı Yayın',
  artwork: artworkUri  // URI string format
}
```

### Asset Used
- **File**: `Trendankara3.png`
- **Size**: 860KB
- **Location**: `/assets/images/`

## Testing Checklist

### iOS Testing
1. **Lock Screen**
   - [ ] TrendAnkara logo appears on lock screen
   - [ ] Logo displays at correct size
   - [ ] Logo quality is good (not pixelated)
   - [ ] Logo updates when playback starts

2. **Control Center**
   - [ ] Logo appears in Now Playing widget
   - [ ] Logo persists during playback
   - [ ] Logo clears when playback stops

3. **CarPlay (if available)**
   - [ ] Logo displays in CarPlay interface
   - [ ] Logo scales appropriately

### Android Testing
1. **Lock Screen**
   - [ ] Logo appears on lock screen media controls
   - [ ] Logo displays correctly on different Android versions
   - [ ] Logo works on both AOSP and custom ROMs

2. **Notification Shade**
   - [ ] Logo appears in media notification
   - [ ] Logo displays in expanded notification view
   - [ ] Logo shows in compact notification

3. **Android Auto (if available)**
   - [ ] Logo displays in Android Auto interface
   - [ ] Logo maintains aspect ratio

## Expected Behavior

### What You Should See
1. Start playing the radio stream
2. Lock the device
3. **TrendAnkara logo** should appear alongside:
   - Title: "TrendAnkara Radyo"
   - Artist: "Canlı Yayın"
   - Play/Pause controls

### Platform Differences
- **iOS**: Logo appears prominently on lock screen
- **Android**: Logo may appear smaller in notification
- Some devices may cache old artwork briefly

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Appearing
1. **Check asset loading**:
   ```bash
   # Verify asset exists
   ls -la assets/images/Trendankara3.png
   ```

2. **Clear cache**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

3. **Force refresh**:
   - Kill the app completely
   - Restart the development server
   - Rebuild the app

### Logo Appears Blurry
- The image is 860KB which should be high quality
- Check device display settings
- Verify no compression is applied

### Wrong Logo or No Update
- iOS/Android may cache artwork
- Force stop the app and restart
- Clear app data if necessary

## Code Verification

The implementation includes:
1. ✅ Asset resolution using `Image.resolveAssetSource`
2. ✅ URI conversion for expo-video compatibility
3. ✅ Metadata object with artwork field
4. ✅ Proper spreading of artwork property

## Success Criteria
- [x] Artwork URI properly resolved from local asset
- [x] Metadata includes artwork field
- [x] Source object correctly formatted
- [ ] Logo appears on physical device lock screen
- [ ] Logo displays at acceptable quality

## Notes
- Using Trendankara3.png (larger, higher quality version)
- Artwork is included in initial player creation and all replacements
- URI format ensures cross-platform compatibility
