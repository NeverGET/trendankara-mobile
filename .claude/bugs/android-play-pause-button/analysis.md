# Bug Analysis

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Summary
After thorough investigation of the audio playback system, I've identified that the issue is specific to how the expo-video player's status is being monitored on Android. The app uses expo-video as a workaround for native media controls since expo-av doesn't support them directly. The status monitoring relies on polling the player's `playing` property, which appears to not update reliably on Android when playback starts.

### Root Cause
The actual root cause was simpler than initially suspected: The `IconSymbol` component in `components/ui/icon-symbol.tsx` was missing the mapping for the pause button icon. It had `'play.circle.fill': 'play-circle-filled'` mapped but was missing `'pause.circle.fill': 'pause-circle-filled'`. On iOS, the component uses native SF Symbols which worked correctly, but on Android it uses Material Icons which require explicit mapping. Without this mapping, the pause icon couldn't be displayed even though the state was updating correctly.

### Contributing Factors
1. **Platform-specific behavior**: The expo-video `player.playing` property behaves differently on Android vs iOS
2. **Polling-based status updates**: Relying on interval-based polling instead of event-driven updates
3. **Race condition**: The play() method completes but the status check happens before Android updates the internal playing state
4. **Missing event listeners**: Not using expo-video's event system to detect playback state changes

## Technical Details

### Affected Code Locations
- **File**: `services/audio/ExpoVideoPlayerProvider.tsx`
  - **Function/Method**: Status monitoring effect (lines 79-118)
  - **Lines**: 83-84 (checking `player.playing`)
  - **Issue**: The `player.playing` property doesn't update immediately on Android after `player.play()` is called

- **File**: `services/audio/ExpoVideoPlayerProvider.tsx`
  - **Function/Method**: `play()` callback (lines 140-172)
  - **Lines**: 160 (calling `player.play()`)
  - **Issue**: After calling play(), the status remains in 'loading' state because the polling doesn't detect the playing state

- **File**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
  - **Function/Method**: UI rendering logic
  - **Lines**: 40-45 (IconSymbol component)
  - **Issue**: Shows play/pause icon based on `isPlaying` state which never becomes true on Android

### Data Flow Analysis
1. User taps play button in `index.tsx`
2. `handlePlayPause` calls `play()` from the hook
3. `play()` in `ExpoVideoPlayerProvider` sets state to 'loading' and calls `player.play()`
4. Status monitoring interval checks `player.playing` every 500ms
5. On iOS: `player.playing` returns true → state updates to 'playing' → UI shows pause button
6. On Android: `player.playing` remains false → state stays 'loading' → UI keeps showing play button

### Dependencies
- expo-video (^2.0.0) - The video player library being used for audio playback
- React Native platform differences between iOS and Android
- Native media player implementations on each platform

## Impact Analysis

### Direct Impact
- Android users cannot see visual feedback that audio is playing
- Users cannot pause playback through the main UI button
- Confusing user experience where audio plays but button doesn't update

### Indirect Impact
- Users may tap play button multiple times thinking it didn't work
- Background playback controls may be affected
- User trust in app reliability is diminished on Android platform

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Core functionality broken for all Android users
- **No Workaround**: Users have no alternative way to pause from main screen
- **Platform Parity**: iOS works perfectly, making Android seem inferior

## Solution Approach

### Fix Strategy
Instead of relying solely on polling `player.playing`, we should:
1. Use expo-video's event system to detect playback state changes
2. Set `isPlaying` to true immediately after calling `play()` for Android
3. Add a platform-specific workaround that assumes playback started successfully on Android
4. Implement proper event listeners for playback status changes

### Alternative Solutions
1. **Option A**: Force status update after play() on Android
   - Immediately set `isPlaying: true` after `player.play()` on Android
   - Simple but might not reflect actual playback state

2. **Option B**: Use expo-video events (Recommended)
   - Listen to playback status events from expo-video
   - More reliable and event-driven approach

3. **Option C**: Increase polling frequency on Android
   - Reduce interval from 500ms to 100ms on Android only
   - Not ideal but might catch state changes faster

### Risks and Trade-offs
- **Option A Risk**: UI might show playing when audio hasn't actually started
- **Option B Risk**: Need to ensure events fire reliably on both platforms
- **Option C Risk**: Higher CPU usage from frequent polling

## Implementation Plan

### Changes Required
1. **Change 1**: Add event listeners for playback status
   - File: `services/audio/ExpoVideoPlayerProvider.tsx`
   - Modification: Add event listeners for `playingChange` or status events

2. **Change 2**: Platform-specific play handling
   - File: `services/audio/ExpoVideoPlayerProvider.tsx`
   - Modification: After calling `player.play()`, immediately set `isPlaying: true` on Android

3. **Change 3**: Improve status monitoring
   - File: `services/audio/ExpoVideoPlayerProvider.tsx`
   - Modification: Combine event-driven updates with polling as fallback

### Testing Strategy
1. Test on physical Android device (not simulator)
2. Verify play button changes to pause immediately after tap
3. Test pause functionality works correctly
4. Verify iOS functionality remains unaffected
5. Test background playback controls
6. Test with poor network conditions

### Rollback Plan
If the fix causes issues:
1. Revert changes to `ExpoVideoPlayerProvider.tsx`
2. Return to polling-only approach
3. Document as known Android limitation
4. Consider alternative audio libraries if expo-video continues to have issues
