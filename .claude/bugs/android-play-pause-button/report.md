# Bug Report

## Bug Summary
On Android devices, when media playback starts, the Pause button and its icon do not appear after clicking the Play button, while on iOS the functionality works correctly.

## Bug Details

### Expected Behavior
When the user clicks the Play button to start media playback, the button should immediately change to display a Pause button with the appropriate pause icon, allowing the user to pause the playback.

### Actual Behavior
On Android devices, after clicking the Play button and starting media playback:
- The Play button does not change to a Pause button
- The pause icon does not appear
- Users cannot pause the playback through the expected button interface

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the Trend Ankara app on an Android device
2. Navigate to the main Radio Player tab
3. Click the Play button to start streaming
4. Observe that the button does not change to show Pause functionality

### Environment
- **Version**: Trend Ankara Mobile App (current development version)
- **Platform**: Android (all versions)
- **Configuration**:
  - Expo SDK 54
  - React Native 0.81.4
  - expo-av for audio playback
  - Shoutcast streaming URL: https://radyo.yayin.com.tr:5132/

## Impact Assessment

### Severity
- [x] High - Major functionality broken
- [ ] Critical - System unusable
- [ ] Medium - Feature impaired but workaround exists
- [ ] Low - Minor issue or cosmetic

### Affected Users
All Android users of the Trend Ankara app are impacted, preventing them from having proper playback controls.

### Affected Features
- Radio Player main functionality
- Media playback controls
- User experience for Android platform
- Background playback control (potentially)

## Additional Context

### Error Messages
```
No specific error messages reported - the button simply fails to update its visual state
```

### Screenshots/Media
The Play button remains in its initial state even after audio begins playing, unlike iOS where it correctly transitions to show Pause functionality.

### Related Issues
- May be related to native control implementation differences between iOS and Android
- Possibly connected to expo-av audio component behavior on Android
- Could involve state management for playback status

## Initial Analysis

### Suspected Root Cause
- Platform-specific implementation issue with the audio player controls
- State update not triggering UI re-render on Android
- Possible race condition in Android's audio playback callback
- Icon component may not be receiving proper state updates on Android

### Affected Components
- `components/player/PlayButton.tsx` or similar play/pause button component
- `hooks/useAudio.ts` or `hooks/useAudioWithNativeControls.ts` - audio playback hooks
- `services/audio/player.ts` - audio player service logic
- Native control integration code for Android platform
- State management for playback status
