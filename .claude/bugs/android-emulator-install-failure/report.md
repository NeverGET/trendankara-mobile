# Bug Report

## Bug Summary
Android emulator fails to install APK with "adb install" command returning exit code 1, preventing app deployment to the virtual Android device.

## Bug Details

### Expected Behavior
After successful build, the APK should install smoothly on the Android emulator (emulator-5554) allowing the app to run and test on the virtual device.

### Actual Behavior
The build completes successfully but the installation phase fails with:
- ADB command exits with non-zero code: 1
- Installation process aborts
- App cannot be deployed to the emulator

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Start Android emulator (emulator-5554)
2. Run the Expo development build command
3. Wait for build to complete (builds successfully)
4. Observe installation failure when attempting to install APK

### Environment
- **Version**: Expo SDK 54, React Native 0.81.4
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin 25.0.0)
- **Configuration**:
  - Android SDK: `/Users/cemalkurt/Library/Android/sdk`
  - Gradle: 8.14.3
  - Emulator: emulator-5554
  - Build location: `/Users/cemalkurt/Projects/trendankara/mobile/android`

## Impact Assessment

### Severity
- [x] High - Major functionality broken

### Affected Users
Development team - Unable to test Android app on emulators, blocking Android development and testing workflow.

### Affected Features

- Problems report generated at: `file:///Users/cemalkurt/Projects/trendankara/mobile/android/build/reports/problems/problems-report.html`

## Initial Analysis

### Suspected Root Cause
Several potential causes:
1. Emulator storage full or insufficient space
2. Previous app installation conflict or corrupted APK remnants
3. ADB permissions or connectivity issues with emulator
4. Emulator system image compatibility issues
5. Package name conflicts or signing issues

### Affected Components
- ADB installation process
- Android emulator configuration
- Expo CLI Android deployment module (`@expo/cli/src/start/platforms/android`)
- Android build configuration
