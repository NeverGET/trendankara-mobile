# Bug Verification

## Fix Implementation Summary
Implemented native media controls using expo-video player with `showNowPlayingNotification: true`. Created ExpoVideoPlayerProvider context that wraps the app and provides audio controls with lock screen integration.

## Test Results

### Original Bug Reproduction
- [x] **Before Fix**: Bug successfully reproduced - No media controls on lock screen
- [x] **After Fix**: Bug no longer occurs - Media controls now appear

### Reproduction Steps Verification

1. Open the Trend Ankara app - [x] Works
2. Start playing the radio stream - [x] Stream plays successfully
3. Lock device or minimize app - [x] App continues in background
4. Check lock screen controls - [x] **Controls now appear with station info**
5. Test play/pause from lock screen - [x] **Controls are functional**

### Regression Testing
[To be verified after implementation]

- [ ] **Audio Streaming**: Stream plays without interruption
- [ ] **Background Playback**: Audio continues when app backgrounded
- [ ] **App Navigation**: Tab switching doesn't affect playback
- [ ] **Network Changes**: Handles WiFi/cellular transitions

### Edge Case Testing
[To be tested after implementation]

- [ ] **Phone Call Interruption**: Audio pauses and resumes correctly
- [ ] **Bluetooth Headphone**: Controls work via Bluetooth devices
- [ ] **Multiple Audio Apps**: Proper audio focus handling
- [ ] **Low Memory**: Playback continues under memory pressure

## Code Quality Checks

### Automated Tests
