# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up the production codebase by removing debugging console logs with emoji usage, removing SSL testing code that is no longer needed (since SSL issues have been resolved through the proxy server), and cleaning up commented-out code and unused imports. The goal is to produce a professional, release-ready codebase with only necessary logging for error tracking and critical warnings.

The cleanup will ensure that:
- All debugging logs with emoji are removed
- Necessary error/warning logs remain but are reformatted professionally without emoji
- SSL testing and certificate bypass code is removed (since proxy server is now the permanent solution)
- Commented-out code blocks are cleaned up
- Development-only code is properly wrapped in conditional checks

## Terminology

- **Debug Log**: Any console.log, console.debug statement used for development tracing and debugging
- **Error Log**: console.error statements for runtime errors requiring investigation
- **Warning Log**: console.warn statements for critical warnings in production that indicate potential issues
- **Production Code**: Code included in release builds (not wrapped in `__DEV__` conditionals)
- **Development Code**: Code wrapped in `__DEV__` conditionals, automatically stripped from production builds
- **Emoji Character**: Any Unicode character in the emoji ranges (U+1F300-U+1F9FF and related blocks)
- **Professional Logging**: Logging output that is clear, searchable, parseable, and free of decorative characters

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product vision's core principle of **"Simple is better"** by reducing unnecessary code complexity and console noise in production. It also aligns with **"No overengineering"** by removing temporary testing infrastructure that is no longer needed since the SSL issues have been permanently resolved through the proxy server solution.

From the technology standards, this cleanup supports the code quality requirements for production-ready applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 (LOG-CLEANUP-001): Production Logging Standards

**User Story:** As a production support engineer, I want clean, professional logging output without decorative characters, so that logs are easily searchable, parseable by log aggregation tools, and provide actionable error information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **LOG-CLEANUP-001.1**: WHEN the application runs in production mode (not `__DEV__`) THEN the system SHALL NOT output any console.log statements containing emoji characters AND a regex scan of production logs SHALL return zero matches for emoji patterns
2. **LOG-CLEANUP-001.2**: WHEN an error occurs in production THEN the system SHALL log using console.error with descriptive context (error message, component name, relevant data) WITHOUT emoji characters
3. **LOG-CLEANUP-001.3**: WHEN a critical warning needs to be logged THEN the system SHALL use console.warn with clear, actionable messaging WITHOUT emoji characters
4. **LOG-CLEANUP-001.4**: WHEN the production build is created THEN all debugging console.log statements SHALL be wrapped in `if (__DEV__)` conditionals OR removed entirely
5. **LOG-CLEANUP-001.5**: WHEN cleanup is complete THEN a static code analysis tool SHALL report zero instances of emoji in console statements outside of `__DEV__` blocks

#### Verification Methods
- ESLint rule configuration: Enforce no-console in production mode (excluding console.error, console.warn)
- Regex pattern scan: `/[\u{1F300}-\u{1F9FF}\u{2600}-\u{26FF}\u{2700}-\u{27BF}]/u` for emoji detection in source files
- Test suite: All existing unit and integration tests SHALL pass with 100% success rate
- Production build verification: Manual review of production console output shows only error/warning logs without emoji

### Requirement 2 (LOG-CLEANUP-002): SSL Testing Code Removal

**User Story:** As a software engineer maintaining the application, I want all SSL testing and certificate bypass code removed, so that the codebase is maintainable, secure, and contains only production-ready code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **LOG-CLEANUP-002.1**: WHEN the codebase is scanned for SSL testing utilities THEN zero files named `testConnection.ts` SHALL exist in the services directory
2. **LOG-CLEANUP-002.2**: WHEN searching for SSL certificate bypass code THEN zero references to `rejectUnauthorized: false` SHALL exist outside of the production proxy implementation (trendankara-proxy/index.js)
3. **LOG-CLEANUP-002.3**: WHEN the codebase is scanned for proxy testing utilities THEN files `local-server.js` and `test-proxy.js` in trendankara-proxy directory SHALL be deleted OR moved to a separate testing repository
4. **LOG-CLEANUP-002.4**: WHEN the initialization service runs THEN zero calls to `testApiConnection()` SHALL execute AND no imports of `testConnection` module SHALL exist
5. **LOG-CLEANUP-002.5**: WHEN all SSL testing code is removed THEN the application SHALL build successfully for both iOS and Android platforms AND all API integration tests SHALL pass

#### Verification Methods
- Grep search: `grep -r "testConnection" services/` returns zero results
- Grep search: `grep -r "rejectUnauthorized" --exclude="trendankara-proxy/index.js"` returns zero results
- File existence check: Verify deletion of test utility files
- Build verification: `npm run build` completes successfully
- Test suite: All API integration tests pass

### Requirement 3 (LOG-CLEANUP-003): Code Quality and Documentation

**User Story:** As a software engineer onboarding to the project, I want the codebase to be free of commented-out code and have clear documentation, so that I can understand the active, maintained code without confusion from legacy artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **LOG-CLEANUP-003.1**: WHEN reviewing source files THEN zero commented-out function calls or API implementations SHALL exist in Redux slices
2. **LOG-CLEANUP-003.2**: WHEN scanning for commented imports THEN all unused import statements (commented or active) SHALL be removed from the codebase
3. **LOG-CLEANUP-003.3**: WHEN encountering commented code with context THEN the code SHALL be removed AND the explanatory context SHALL be converted to JSDoc documentation IF it provides value
4. **LOG-CLEANUP-003.4**: WHEN TODO or FIXME comments exist THEN they SHALL be preserved only IF they reference active issues in the issue tracker OR contain actionable information
5. **LOG-CLEANUP-003.5**: WHEN cleanup is complete THEN a code review SHALL confirm zero instances of commented-out implementation code AND the test suite SHALL pass with 100% success rate

#### Verification Methods
- Regex scan: Search for patterns like `// const`, `// import`, `// export`, `// async function`
- Manual code review: Review Redux slices and service files for commented code
- ESLint rule: Enable no-unused-imports rule and verify zero violations
- Test suite: All tests pass after cleanup

### Requirement 4 (LOG-CLEANUP-004): Development Code Isolation

**User Story:** As a release engineer preparing production builds, I want all development-only code properly isolated using conditional compilation, so that debug utilities are automatically stripped from production builds and don't impact performance or bundle size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **LOG-CLEANUP-004.1**: WHEN development-only cache clearing code exists THEN it SHALL be wrapped in `if (__DEV__) { }` conditionals OR removed entirely if temporary
2. **LOG-CLEANUP-004.2**: WHEN mock data is defined in source files THEN it SHALL be clearly documented with comments indicating "Development only" AND wrapped in conditional checks
3. **LOG-CLEANUP-004.3**: WHEN the production build is created THEN the bundle size SHALL NOT include development-only code AND the bundle analyzer SHALL show zero debug utilities in production chunks
4. **LOG-CLEANUP-004.4**: WHEN mock data usage is evaluated THEN clear documentation SHALL exist indicating which components use mocks in development versus real API calls in production
5. **LOG-CLEANUP-004.5**: WHEN cleanup is complete THEN a production build review SHALL confirm all `__DEV__` conditional blocks are properly stripped AND application functionality is preserved

#### Verification Methods
- Bundle analyzer: Review production bundle to confirm debug code exclusion
- Build size comparison: Production bundle size SHALL be reduced by at least 1KB OR remain unchanged (not increase)
- Code scan: Verify all development code is wrapped in `__DEV__` conditionals
- Test suite: All tests pass in both development and production builds

### Requirement 5 (LOG-CLEANUP-005): Safety and Rollback

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want automated safety checks during code cleanup, so that we can detect breaking changes immediately and rollback if necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **LOG-CLEANUP-005.1**: WHEN any cleanup task is completed THEN all existing unit tests SHALL pass with 100% success rate
2. **LOG-CLEANUP-005.2**: WHEN all requirements are implemented THEN the application SHALL build successfully for both iOS and Android platforms without errors or warnings
3. **LOG-CLEANUP-005.3**: IF any test fails after cleanup THEN the changes SHALL be reverted AND the failure SHALL be documented in the implementation notes
4. **LOG-CLEANUP-005.4**: WHEN cleanup is complete THEN a manual smoke test SHALL verify core features: audio playback, news loading, poll voting, and settings persistence
5. **LOG-CLEANUP-005.5**: WHEN all changes are verified THEN a git branch SHALL be created for review BEFORE merging to main branch

#### Verification Methods
- Automated test suite: Run full test suite and verify 100% pass rate
- Build verification: Execute iOS and Android builds successfully
- Manual testing checklist: Test radio playback, news browsing, poll interaction, settings changes
- Git workflow: Create feature branch and PR for review
