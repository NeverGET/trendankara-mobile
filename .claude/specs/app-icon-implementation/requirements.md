# Requirements Document - App Icon Implementation

## Introduction

This feature implements modern, adaptive app icons for the Trend Ankara mobile application on both iOS and Android platforms. The implementation will use the existing SVG logo (`trendankaralogo.svg`) to generate platform-specific icons that support the latest iOS 18 appearance modes (light, dark, tinted) and Android 13+ themed icons (Material You). This ensures the app icon properly adapts to user preferences and system themes while maintaining brand consistency.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports the product vision of Trend Ankara as a "simple, elegant radio station mobile app" by:
- Enhancing brand identity through consistent, professional app icon presentation
- Supporting the red, black, and white brand color scheme
- Providing a polished user experience that adapts to user preferences (dark/light mode)
- Maintaining professional brand presence on mobile platforms across all system themes
- Following the "simple is better" principle with clean icon design

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: SVG-Based Icon Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert the SVG logo into platform-specific icon formats, so that the app maintains visual quality across all device resolutions and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SVG logo is processed THEN the system SHALL generate PNG icons at all required resolutions for iOS (1024x1024 base)
2. IF the target platform is iOS THEN the system SHALL generate icons supporting Display P3 wide-gamut color space with sRGB fallback
3. WHEN generating Android icons THEN the system SHALL create adaptive icon layers (foreground, background, monochrome) at 108x108 dp
4. IF rounded corners are needed for compatibility THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate alpha channels to PNG exports
5. WHEN icons are generated THEN the system SHALL preserve the red (#e53e3e), black (#000000), and white (#ffffff) brand colors

### Requirement 2: iOS 18 Appearance Modes Support

**User Story:** As an iOS user, I want the app icon to adapt to my device's appearance settings, so that it looks cohesive with my chosen system theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has light mode enabled THEN the system SHALL display the standard light mode icon variant
2. IF the user enables dark mode THEN the system SHALL display a dark mode optimized icon with transparent background
3. WHEN the user enables tinted mode THEN the system SHALL display a grayscale icon that adapts to system accent colors
4. IF the device runs iOS 16 or earlier THEN the system SHALL fallback to the standard icon without appearance variations
5. WHEN generating tinted icons THEN the system SHALL use Gray Gamma 2.2 color profile with black (#000000) background

### Requirement 3: Android Material You Theming

**User Story:** As an Android user, I want the app icon to match my device's Material You theme colors, so that it integrates seamlessly with my personalized system appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables themed icons in Android 13+ THEN the system SHALL display the monochrome icon variant
2. IF the device supports adaptive icons THEN the system SHALL provide separate foreground and background layers
3. WHEN creating the monochrome layer THEN the system SHALL ensure the logo fits within the 66x66 dp safe zone
4. IF the device runs Android 12 or earlier THEN the system SHALL display the standard adaptive icon without theming
5. WHEN the monochrome icon is displayed THEN the system SHALL allow the launcher to apply user's wallpaper-based tinting

### Requirement 4: Expo Configuration Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the icon configuration integrated with Expo's build system, so that icons are automatically applied during the build process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring iOS icons THEN the system SHALL update app.json with separate light, dark, and tinted icon paths
2. IF Android adaptive icons are configured THEN the system SHALL specify foregroundImage, backgroundImage, and monochromeImage paths
3. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL ensure all icon files are included in the assets directory structure
4. IF icon files are missing THEN the build system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which variants are required
5. WHEN icons are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing app configurations

### Requirement 5: Legacy Device Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user with an older device, I want to see a properly formatted app icon, so that the app looks professional regardless of my device version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device doesn't support adaptive icons THEN the system SHALL provide standard PNG fallback icons
2. IF the iOS version is below 18 THEN the system SHALL use the single icon configuration without appearance modes
3. WHEN generating fallback icons THEN the system SHALL ensure proper alpha channels for rounded corners
4. IF Android version is below 8.0 (API 26) THEN the system SHALL use legacy square/circular icon formats
5. WHEN fallback icons are used THEN the system SHALL maintain the core brand visual identity

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Icon generation process must complete within 10 seconds
- Generated icons must be optimized for file size without quality loss
- Icon loading must not impact app launch time (< 100ms overhead)

### Security
- No external services should be used for icon generation
- Icon files must be included in the app bundle, not fetched remotely
- Generated icons should not contain metadata that could expose system information

### Reliability
- Icon generation must be deterministic (same input produces same output)
- Build process must validate all required icon variants are present
- Icons must render correctly across all supported device configurations

### Usability
- Icons must be visually recognizable at all sizes (from 20x20 to 1024x1024)
- Brand colors must remain consistent across all icon variants
- Icon must be distinguishable in both light and dark backgrounds
- The "1 3.8" text and play button must remain legible at app icon sizes
