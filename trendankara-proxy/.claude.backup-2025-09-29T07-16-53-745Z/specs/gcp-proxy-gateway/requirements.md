# Requirements Document - GCP Proxy Gateway

## Introduction

This feature implements a Google Cloud Function as a proxy gateway to bypass SSL certificate configuration issues preventing the TrendAnkara mobile application from connecting to its backend API. The proxy will act as an intermediary, handling SSL/TLS connections through Google's infrastructure while forwarding requests transparently to the backend server at trendankara.com.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This solution enables immediate restoration of mobile app functionality without waiting for the one-month timeline needed to fix SSL certificates on the main server. It ensures users can continue accessing all app features while maintaining security through Google's SSL infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Proxy Gateway Core Functionality

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want to access all TrendAnkara API endpoints without SSL errors, so that I can use the app normally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mobile app makes a request to any API endpoint THEN the proxy SHALL forward it to the trendankara.com server
2. IF the backend server responds THEN the proxy SHALL return the exact response to the mobile app
3. WHEN any HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) is used THEN the proxy SHALL support it
4. IF the request contains headers (Authorization, X-Platform, etc.) THEN the proxy SHALL forward them correctly

### Requirement 2: European Region Deployment

**User Story:** As the system administrator, I want the proxy deployed in European data centers, so that latency is minimized for users in Turkey and Netherlands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the function THEN it SHALL be deployed to europe-west3 (Frankfurt) or europe-west4 (Netherlands)
2. IF Frankfurt is unavailable THEN the system SHALL allow deployment to Netherlands as an alternative
3. WHEN deployed THEN the function URL SHALL reflect the European region in its domain

### Requirement 3: Cost Optimization

**User Story:** As the business owner, I want minimal cloud costs, so that the proxy solution remains economically viable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the function THEN memory allocation SHALL be set to 128MB maximum
2. IF no traffic is received THEN the function SHALL scale down to 0 instances
3. WHEN concurrent users increase THEN the function SHALL support up to 100 instances maximum
4. IF the function is idle THEN it SHALL NOT incur charges beyond storage

### Requirement 4: CORS and Mobile App Support

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want proper CORS headers, so that the app can make cross-origin requests without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any request is received THEN the proxy SHALL include proper CORS headers in the response
2. IF an OPTIONS preflight request is received THEN the proxy SHALL respond with 204 status and CORS headers
3. WHEN mobile-specific headers are sent THEN the proxy SHALL preserve them (X-Platform, X-App-Version, X-Device-ID)

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want meaningful error messages when something goes wrong, so that I understand the issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server times out THEN the proxy SHALL return a 504 Gateway Timeout error
2. IF the backend server is unreachable THEN the proxy SHALL return a 502 Bad Gateway error
3. WHEN any other error occurs THEN the proxy SHALL return a 500 Internal Server Error with a generic message
4. IF an error occurs THEN the proxy SHALL log the error details for debugging

### Requirement 6: Transparent API Compatibility

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want to change only the base URL in my app configuration, so that integration is simple.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating the mobile app THEN only the BASE_URL constant SHALL need to be changed
2. IF the proxy URL is configured THEN all existing API paths SHALL work without modification
3. WHEN query parameters are included THEN the proxy SHALL forward them correctly
4. IF request bodies are sent THEN the proxy SHALL forward them without modification

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Response time SHALL be within 200ms of direct connection latency
- The proxy SHALL handle at least 100 concurrent connections
- Function cold start time SHALL be under 3 seconds
- Timeout SHALL be set to 30 seconds to accommodate slow backend responses

### Security
- All connections to the proxy SHALL use HTTPS
- The proxy SHALL NOT store or log sensitive data (passwords, tokens)
- Authentication headers SHALL be forwarded without inspection
- The proxy SHALL use Google Cloud's default service account with minimal permissions

### Reliability
- The proxy SHALL have 99.9% uptime (following Google Cloud SLA)
- The proxy SHALL automatically retry failed requests to the backend (up to 3 attempts)
- The proxy SHALL handle backend SSL errors gracefully
- Function logs SHALL be retained for debugging purposes

### Usability
- Deployment SHALL be automated through a single script
- Configuration SHALL support environment variables for flexibility
- Testing tools SHALL be provided to verify proxy functionality
- Documentation SHALL include clear deployment and troubleshooting guides
