# Baseline Measurements for Log Cleanup Code Removal
# Date: 2025-10-19

## Console Statement Counts
Total console statements (all types): 597
Console.error and console.warn statements: 237

## NFR-REL-001 Verification Baseline
Target range for console.error/warn after cleanup: 213-261 (±10% of 237)

## Purpose
These measurements establish the baseline for verification:
- Total console statements should decrease significantly after cleanup
- Console.error/warn should remain within ±10% of baseline (237)
- Any decrease beyond -10% indicates necessary error logging was removed
- Any increase beyond +10% indicates new error logging was added inadvertently
