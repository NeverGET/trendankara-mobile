# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Background Playback feature enables continuous audio playback for the TrendAnkara Radio app when the application is backgrounded or the device screen is locked. This feature allows users to listen to the radio stream while using other apps or when their device is in their pocket, providing an essential user experience for a radio application. The feature includes native media controls in the notification center (Android) and control center (iOS), allowing users to control playback without reopening the app.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature is critical for a radio application as it enables the core listening experience expected by users. Background playback is a fundamental requirement that allows users to:
- Continue listening while multitasking on their device
- Control playback from lock screen and system media controls
- Maintain a continuous listening experience without keeping the app in foreground
- Reduce battery consumption by allowing screen to be turned off during playback

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: iOS Background Audio Capability

**User Story:** As an iOS user, I want the radio to continue playing when I switch apps or lock my screen, so that I can listen while doing other tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is playing audio AND the user switches to another app THEN the audio SHALL continue playing without interruption
2. WHEN the app is playing audio AND the user locks the device screen THEN the audio SHALL continue playing
3. WHEN background audio is playing AND the user opens the control center THEN the app SHALL display media controls with title "TrendAnkara Radyo"
4. IF the app is terminated by the system while playing THEN the audio SHALL stop gracefully
5. WHEN the user receives a phone call THEN the audio SHALL pause automatically AND resume after the call ends

### Requirement 2: Android Foreground Service

**User Story:** As an Android user, I want the radio to keep playing when I navigate away from the app, so that I can listen continuously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio playback starts THEN the app SHALL create a foreground service with a persistent notification
2. WHEN the foreground service is active THEN the notification SHALL display play/pause controls and current status
3. WHEN the user taps the notification THEN the app SHALL open to the radio player screen
4. IF the user swipes away the app from recent apps THEN the foreground service SHALL continue running
5. WHEN the user explicitly stops playback THEN the foreground service SHALL be terminated

### Requirement 3: Media Controls in Notification/Lock Screen

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control radio playback from my lock screen or notification panel, so that I don't need to unlock my device or open the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN background playback is active THEN media controls SHALL appear in the device's notification center/lock screen
2. WHEN the user taps play/pause in media controls THEN the playback state SHALL update accordingly
3. WHEN the user taps stop/close in media controls THEN the playback SHALL stop AND the service SHALL terminate
4. IF the stream is buffering THEN the media controls SHALL show a loading indicator
5. WHEN media controls are displayed THEN they SHALL show the app icon and "TrendAnkara Radyo" as the title

### Requirement 4: Audio Focus Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to respect other audio apps, so that my music or calls aren't interrupted inappropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another app requests audio focus THEN the radio app SHALL pause playback
2. WHEN audio focus is regained THEN the app SHALL resume playback if it was playing before
3. IF a transient audio interruption occurs (notification sound) THEN the app SHALL duck the volume temporarily
4. WHEN the user explicitly starts playback in another audio app THEN the radio SHALL stop
5. WHEN headphones are disconnected THEN the playback SHALL pause automatically

### Requirement 5: Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my playback session to persist appropriately, so that the app behaves predictably when I return to it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is reopened while background playback is active THEN the UI SHALL reflect the current playback state
2. IF the app was terminated and reopened THEN the playback state SHALL be restored to stopped
3. WHEN background playback is active for more than 30 minutes THEN the session SHALL remain stable
4. IF network connectivity is lost during background playback THEN the app SHALL attempt reconnection with the existing retry logic
5. WHEN the device restarts THEN the app SHALL NOT automatically resume playback

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Background playback SHALL consume less than 5% additional CPU compared to foreground playback
- Audio buffer SHALL maintain at least 15 seconds of content to handle network fluctuations
- Media control response time SHALL be under 200ms
- Battery consumption SHALL not exceed 2% per hour of continuous playback

### Security
- Background service SHALL only access necessary permissions (audio, notification)
- No user data SHALL be transmitted while in background mode
- Media session SHALL be properly secured to prevent hijacking by other apps

### Reliability
- Background playback SHALL remain stable for at least 8 hours of continuous streaming
- Service SHALL handle network switches (WiFi to cellular) without interruption
- App SHALL gracefully handle system resource constraints
- Recovery from interruptions SHALL occur within 5 seconds

### Usability
- Media controls SHALL follow platform-specific design guidelines
- Notification SHALL be non-intrusive but easily accessible
- Playback state SHALL be immediately visible in media controls
- Controls SHALL be accessible with one-handed operation
