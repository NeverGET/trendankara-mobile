# TrackPlayer Migration Rollback Procedure

This document describes how to quickly roll back from `react-native-track-player` to `expo-video` if issues are discovered in production.

## Quick Rollback (No Code Changes Required)

The TrackPlayer migration was designed with instant rollback capability via feature flag.

### Step 1: Toggle Feature Flag

Edit `constants/config.ts` and change:

```typescript
USE_TRACK_PLAYER: false,  // Change from true to false
```

### Step 2: Rebuild and Deploy

**For OTA Update (Fastest - Recommended):**
```bash
eas update --branch production
```

**For Full Native Build (If OTA Doesn't Work):**
```bash
# Android
eas build --platform android --profile production

# iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

### Step 3: Verify Rollback

1. Open the app
2. Start playing radio stream
3. Check logs - should see: `[RadioPlayerControls] VideoPlayerService initialized`
4. Check for `ðŸ“¹ VideoPlayer` badge in development mode
5. Verify no audio cutoffs when song changes

## What Happens During Rollback?

When `USE_TRACK_PLAYER` is set to `false`:

- **Service Selection**: `RadioPlayerControls` automatically uses `videoPlayerService` instead of `trackPlayerService`
- **Metadata Updates**: Static metadata ("Trend Ankara" / "CanlÄ± YayÄ±n") is used instead of dynamic updates
- **Audio Interruption**: 200-500ms cutoffs return (known behavior)
- **Native Controls**: Continue to work via expo-video's notification system

## Rollback Validation Checklist

After rollback, verify these features still work:

- [ ] Radio stream starts playing
- [ ] Play/Pause controls work
- [ ] Stop button works
- [ ] Volume/Mute controls work
- [ ] Lock screen controls appear
- [ ] Background playback continues
- [ ] App doesn't crash on play/pause
- [ ] Bluetooth controls work (if available)

## Common Rollback Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Audio Doesn't Play After Update

**Symptoms:**
- Play button pressed but no audio
- Console shows `[TrackPlayerService] Failed to initialize`

**Solution:**
```typescript
// constants/config.ts
USE_TRACK_PLAYER: false,
```

Then rebuild or OTA update.

### Scenario 2: Metadata Updates Cause Crashes

**Symptoms:**
- App crashes when song changes
- Console shows `[TrackPlayerService] Failed to update metadata`

**Solution:**
Same as Scenario 1 - toggle feature flag and redeploy.

### Scenario 3: Background Playback Stops Working

**Symptoms:**
- Audio stops when app goes to background
- Lock screen controls don't appear

**Solution:**
```typescript
// constants/config.ts
USE_TRACK_PLAYER: false,
```

expo-video's background playback is more stable in this case.

## Gradual Rollout Strategy

To minimize risk, use this gradual rollout approach:

### Phase 1: Development Testing (Current State)
```typescript
USE_TRACK_PLAYER: false,  // Keep disabled initially
```

### Phase 2: Internal Testing
```typescript
USE_TRACK_PLAYER: true,   // Enable for internal builds only
```

Test with team members for 2-3 days.

### Phase 3: Beta Testing (10% of users)
```typescript
USE_TRACK_PLAYER: true,   // Enable for beta channel
```

Deploy via `eas update --branch beta` and monitor for 1 week.

### Phase 4: Production Rollout (100% of users)
```typescript
USE_TRACK_PLAYER: true,   // Enable for production
```

Deploy via `eas update --branch production`.

### Phase 5: Monitoring Period

Monitor for 2 weeks:
- Crash rates
- Audio playback errors
- User complaints about audio issues

## Permanent Removal (Optional - After 30 Days Success)

If TrackPlayer works perfectly for 30+ days, consider removing expo-video dependencies:

**DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN!**

1. Remove expo-video from `package.json`
2. Remove expo-video plugin from `app.json`
3. Delete `VideoPlayerService.ts`
4. Remove `USE_TRACK_PLAYER` feature flag (always use TrackPlayer)

## Emergency Contact

If rollback doesn't work or issues persist:

1. Check `__tests__/services/audio/` for test failures
2. Review logs in Expo Application Services
3. Check GitHub Issues: https://github.com/doublesymmetry/react-native-track-player/issues
4. Review expo-video documentation: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/video/

## Key Files for Rollback

**Configuration:**
- `constants/config.ts` - Feature flags
- `app.json` - Native plugins

**Service Files:**
- `services/audio/VideoPlayerService.ts` - Fallback service (KEEP THIS!)
- `services/audio/TrackPlayerService.ts` - New service
- `services/audio/PlaybackService.ts` - Background service
- `index.js` - Service registration

**Component Integration:**
- `components/radio/RadioPlayerControls.tsx` - Service selection logic

**Tests:**
- `__tests__/services/audio/TrackPlayerService.test.ts`
- `__tests__/services/audio/PlaybackService.test.ts`
- `__tests__/components/radio/RadioPlayerControls.test.tsx`

## Rollback Success Criteria

Rollback is successful when:

1. âœ… App builds without errors
2. âœ… Radio stream plays audio
3. âœ… No increase in crash rate
4. âœ… Background playback works
5. âœ… Lock screen controls work
6. âœ… All unit tests pass

## Post-Rollback Analysis

If rollback was necessary, investigate:

1. **What went wrong?**
   - Check error logs
   - Review user reports
   - Analyze crash reports

2. **Was it a bug or limitation?**
   - Bug: Can be fixed and redeployed
   - Limitation: May need alternative solution

3. **Can we fix and retry?**
   - Yes: Fix issue, test thoroughly, redeploy
   - No: Keep expo-video, document why
