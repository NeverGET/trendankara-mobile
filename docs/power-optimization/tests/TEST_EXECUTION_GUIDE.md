# Test Execution Guide: Metadata Polling Power Optimization

## Overview

This guide provides the complete test suite for verifying the metadata polling power optimization implementation. The feature implements platform-specific, context-aware metadata polling that reduces power consumption by 85-95% during background audio playback.

**Feature Specification**: `.claude/specs/metadata-polling-power-optimization/`

## Test Suite Summary

| Task | Test Name | Platform | Duration | Prerequisites | Expected Result |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 14 | Android Integration Test | Android | 20 min | Physical Android device | Zero HTTP requests, native metadata events |
| 15 | iOS Foreground Test | iOS | 10 min | Physical iOS device, Mac | 120 requests in 10 min (5s interval) |
| 16 | iOS Background Test | iOS | 20 min | Physical iOS device, Mac | 10 requests in 20 min (2min interval) |
| 17 | iOS State Transition Test | iOS | 5 min | Physical iOS device, Mac | Dynamic interval switching, <1s wake latency |

**Total test time**: ~55 minutes (can be run in parallel with 2 devices)

## Quick Start

### For Android Testing (Task 14)
```bash
cd docs/power-optimization/tests
./android-monitor.sh
# Select option 6 for full automated test
```

### For iOS Testing (Tasks 15-17)
1. Connect iPhone to Mac
2. Open Xcode Console
3. Follow detailed procedures in:
   - `02-ios-foreground-integration-test.md`
   - `03-ios-background-integration-test.md`
   - `04-ios-state-transition-integration-test.md`

## Test Documents

### 1. Android Device Integration Test (Task 14)
**File**: `01-android-integration-test.md`

**Objective**: Verify Android eliminates HTTP metadata polling entirely.

**Key Success Criteria**:
- Zero HTTP requests in 20 minutes
- Native metadata events via Event.AudioCommonMetadataReceived
- CPU usage <10% in background
- Battery drain <12%/hour

**Helper Script**: `android-monitor.sh`

**Quick Test**:
```bash
# Automated 20-minute test with analysis
./android-monitor.sh
# Choose option 6: Full test suite
```

**Manual Test**:
```bash
# Monitor logs in real-time
adb logcat | grep -E "(useNowPlaying|PlaybackService)"
```

**Expected Logs**:
```
[useNowPlaying] Android detected - skipping HTTP metadata polling
[PlaybackService] Metadata received from stream (Android): {...}
```

**NOT Expected**:
```
[useNowPlaying] Fetching metadata from: <url>  ← Should NEVER appear
```

```

**Expected Logs**:
```
[useNowPlaying] Starting polling with 5000ms interval (appState: active)
[useNowPlaying] Fetching metadata from: <url>  ← Every 5 seconds
```

**Request Count Verification**:
```bash
# After saving console output to file
grep -c "Fetching metadata from:" ios-console.log
# Should output: ~120
```

---

### 3. iOS Background Integration Test (Task 16)
**File**: `03-ios-background-integration-test.md`

**Objective**: Verify iOS reduces polling to 2 minutes in background for power savings.

**Key Success Criteria**:
- 8-12 requests in 20 minutes (expected: 10)
- Consistent 2-minute intervals
- CPU usage <10%
- Battery drain <8% in 20 minutes (<24%/hour)

**Test Procedure**:
1. Start playback
2. Lock device immediately
3. Monitor for 20 minutes
4. Verify request count and battery drain

**Expected Logs**:
```
[useNowPlaying] App state transition: active → background
[useNowPlaying] Starting polling with 120000ms interval (appState: background)
[useNowPlaying] Fetching metadata from: <url>  ← Every 2 minutes
```

**Power Savings**:
- Foreground: 240 requests / 20 min
- Background: 10 requests / 20 min
- **Reduction: 95.8%**

---

### 4. iOS State Transition Integration Test (Task 17)
**File**: `04-ios-state-transition-integration-test.md`

**Objective**: Verify dynamic interval switching and immediate wake-up fetch.

**Key Success Criteria**:
- State transitions detected correctly
- Interval switches: 5s → 2min → 5s
- Immediate metadata fetch on wake
- Fresh metadata within 1 second of unlock

**Test Timeline**:
```
T=0s:   Start playback (foreground)
        → 5s interval polling starts
T=15s:  Lock device
        → Transition to 2min interval
T=75s:  Unlock device
        → Immediate fetch triggers
        → Resume 5s interval
```

**Expected Logs**:
```
[useNowPlaying] App state transition: active → background
[useNowPlaying] Starting polling with 120000ms interval (appState: background)
... (60 seconds later) ...
[useNowPlaying] App state transition: background → active
[useNowPlaying] App became active - fetching metadata immediately
[useNowPlaying] Fetching metadata from: <url>
[useNowPlaying] Starting polling with 5000ms interval (appState: active)
```

**Critical Measurement**: Unlock → Metadata visible = <1000ms

## Success Criteria Matrix

| Requirement | Task 14 (Android) | Task 15 (iOS FG) | Task 16 (iOS BG) | Task 17 (iOS Trans) |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Platform detection | ✓ Android logs | ✓ iOS logs | ✓ iOS logs | ✓ iOS logs |
| HTTP requests | 0 | ~120 in 10min | ~10 in 20min | Dynamic |
| Polling interval | N/A (native events) | 5 seconds | 120 seconds | 5s ↔ 120s |
| State awareness | N/A | Active only | Background only | Both + transitions |
| CPU usage | <10% | 5-15% (acceptable) | <10% | <10% |
| Battery drain | <12%/hr | Moderate | <12%/hr | N/A (5min test) |
| Metadata latency | <5 seconds | <1 second | <2 minutes | <1s on wake |
| Audio quality | Perfect | Perfect | Perfect | Perfect |

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: No Logs Appearing

**Android**:
```bash
# Check logcat permissions
adb logcat

# Verify app is running
adb shell ps | grep trendankara

# Check log level
adb logcat -v time | grep -i "useNowPlaying\|PlaybackService"
```

**iOS**:
- Verify device selected in Console
- Check process filter: "TrendAnkara" or "All Processes"
- Clear filters and try again
- Restart Console app

### Issue: Wrong Request Count

**Too Many Requests**:
- Check if app woke to foreground
- Verify device stayed locked
- Check for notification interruptions

**Too Few Requests**:
- Check network connectivity
- Look for error logs
- Verify app didn't crash

### Issue: High Battery Drain

**Android**:
```bash
# Check if HTTP polling disabled
adb logcat -d | grep "Android detected"

# Verify native events
adb logcat -d | grep "Metadata received from stream"
```

**iOS**:
- Verify background interval (120s, not 5s)
- Check for other background activity
- Verify Low Power Mode disabled

### Issue: Audio Interruptions

**All Platforms**:
- Verify TrackPlayer setup correct
- Check for errors during metadata updates
- Test with metadata polling disabled to isolate issue

## Log Analysis

Performance Verification:
[ ] Android: 95% power reduction achieved
[ ] iOS: 85-95% background power reduction achieved
[ ] All platforms: CPU <10% in background
[ ] All platforms: Audio quality excellent
```

## Power Savings Verification

### Expected Power Reduction

#### Android
- **Before**: ~240 HTTP requests / 20 min
- **After**: 0 HTTP requests / 20 min
- **Reduction**: 100% (HTTP polling eliminated)
- **Power savings**: ~95% (CPU wake events eliminated)

#### iOS Background
- **Before**: ~240 HTTP requests / 20 min (5s interval)
- **After**: ~10 HTTP requests / 20 min (2min interval)
- **Reduction**: 95.8%
- **Power savings**: 85-95% (CPU wake events reduced)

#### iOS Foreground
- **No change**: Still 5s interval (user expects real-time updates)
- **Trade-off**: UX prioritized over power in foreground

### Battery Drain Comparison

| Scenario | Before | After | Improvement |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Android background | ~35%/hr | <10%/hr | 71% reduction |
| iOS background | ~35%/hr | <12%/hr | 66% reduction |
| iOS foreground | ~35%/hr | ~35%/hr | No change (intentional) |

## Troubleshooting Resources

### Log Patterns to Debug

#### Platform Detection Issue
```bash
# Should see one of these:
grep "Android detected\|iOS" console.log
```

#### State Transition Issue
```bash
# iOS should show transitions:
grep "App state transition" console.log
```

#### Polling Interval Issue
```bash
# Check interval values:
grep "Starting polling with.*interval" console.log
```

#### Metadata Fetch Issue
```bash
# Check for errors:
grep -i "error\|failed\|timeout" console.log
```

### Getting Help

If tests fail:
1. Review the specific test document for troubleshooting section
2. Check the implementation files:
   - `hooks/useNowPlaying.ts` (polling logic)
   - `services/audio/PlaybackService.ts` (Android native events)
   - `services/audio/TrackPlayerService.ts` (metadata updates)
3. Verify prerequisites met (device, OS version, network, etc.)
4. Try running a single test in isolation
5. Check for app updates or configuration changes
